2006-12-07      Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* fix call to input_volume() in createLaplacianGrid.c
          to allow reading the -like file in any datatype in
          -from_surfaces mode (would crash if not in NC_BYTE)
	* add check to avoid endless streamlines (when streamline
          spirals around a local max)

2006-11-23
        * added the option to save the gradients as minc volumes

2006-08-28	Jason Lerch	<jason@sickkids.ca>
	* added the ability to average values of a volume along a streamline.
	* made averaging accessible through -average_along_streamlines option
	* bumped version number to 1.1
	* added Claude to AUTHORS (about time!)
	
2006-08-14      Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* fix createLaplacianGrid_main.c to make use of return value from 
          create_mantle and return a value itself (used by Laplacian 
          thickness).
	* fix create_mantle to pass out_volume by reference (I have no
          clue how this could have worked before).

2006-06-01      Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * get rid of ParseArgv and use the one from minc library
        * fix return value from create_mantle to return a status code

2006-05-04      Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * clean-up MNI::DataDir stuff

2006-04-27      Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * epm-header and packaging for minc2 m4 files

2006-03-09      Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * Restore command line options for backward compatibility for 
          gradients calculation, but still force it to be in floats.
          This is to avoid the old clasp to crash with -gradients-double.

2006-01-18      Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

        * SOR Gauss-Seidel solver for better convergence
        * New error norm for convergence test
        * Fixed the hopefully correctly implemented fourth order
        Runge-Kutta method (missing h)
        * Forced floats for gradients calculation
        * Removed clipping at 50 steps for integration (this was
        giving truncated streamlines)

2004-08-10	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* Switched the fixed grid to be a mniVolume rather than a
	mniLabelVolume, since for some reason that was causing problems
	on linux.
	* Take absolute values during convergence checking. Appears to
	work better.
	
2002-05-06	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* fourth order Runge-Kutta method (hopefully correctly) implemented.

2002-05-06	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* using function pointers for the integration step. Can now handle
	a second order runge-kutta model. A fourth order runge-kutta is
	still in the works, as are real options in order to let the user
	control which approach to take.
	
2002-04-21	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* improved the layered thickness implementation
2002-04-20	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* started the ChangeLog (finally)
	* added the linear_thickness directory
	* started a layered linear thickness implementation
