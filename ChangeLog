        * Restore command line options for backward compatibility for 
          gradients calculation, but still force it to be in floats.
          This is to avoid the old clasp to crash with -gradients-double.

        * SOR Gauss-Seidel solver for better convergence
        * New error norm for convergence test
        * Fixed the hopefully correctly implemented fourth order
        Runge-Kutta method (missing h)
        * Forced floats for gradients calculation
        * Removed clipping at 50 steps for integration (this was
        giving truncated streamlines)

	* Switched the fixed grid to be a mniVolume rather than a
	mniLabelVolume, since for some reason that was causing problems
	on linux.
	* Take absolute values during convergence checking. Appears to
	work better.

	* fourth order Runge-Kutta method (hopefully correctly) implemented.

2002-05-06	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* using function pointers for the integration step. Can now handle
	a second order runge-kutta model. A fourth order runge-kutta is
	still in the works, as are real options in order to let the user
	control which approach to take.

	* improved the layered thickness implementation
2002-04-20	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* started the ChangeLog (finally)
	* added the linear_thickness directory
	* started a layered linear thickness implementation
